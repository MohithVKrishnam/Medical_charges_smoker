💊 Medical Charges Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict individual medical insurance charges using a regression model trained on real-world data. The dataset used comes from Kaggle's insurance dataset, which includes features such as age, BMI, smoking status, number of children, and region.

🔍 Project Highlights
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized relationships between features and medical charges to uncover insights.

Model Building: Implemented multiple regression models using scikit-learn, including:

Linear Regression

Lasso and Ridge Regression

Polynomial Regression

Evaluation: Compared model performances using metrics such as R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Visualization: Included detailed plots for regression fits and model comparisons.
